## Reverse Shell

Basically me going through some udemy classes and trying to learn python among other things

In this project there are two projects
- What is run server side, which in this case is going to probably be your computer, as you want to be the one sending the data, and seeing the stdout in.

- What is run on the client, the computer that you are trying to execute shell commands on 

_hopefully the poor comments explain things_
